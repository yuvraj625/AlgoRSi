# Algorithmic RSI Trading Project

## Project Overview
This project involves the development and back-testing of an algorithmic trading strategy using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as key indicators. The primary objective is to optimize decision-making in trading within the capital markets using these technical indicators.

## Key Features
- **Indicators Used**:
  - **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: Utilized to measure the speed and change of price movements, indicating overbought or oversold conditions in the market.
  - **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Applied to identify trends in the price data and signal potential entry or exit points for trades.

## Performance Metrics
The algorithmic RSI trading strategy has achieved the following results in back-testing:
- **Annual Returns**: +64.45%
- **Cumulative Returns**: +62.83%
- **Annual Volatility**: +28.04%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 1.91
- **Maximum Drawdown**: ‐10.89%
- **Omega Ratio**: 1.42
- **Sortino Ratio**: 3.04
- **Skewness**: ‐0.1
- **Kurtosis**: 4.72
- **Stability of Time Series**: 89.75%

## Usage Instructions
1. **Implementation**: The algorithm is implemented using Python and can be deployed using various trading platforms that support algorithmic trading.
2. **Configuration**: Ensure you set up the necessary parameters for RSI and EMA to suit your trading preferences and market conditions.
3. **Testing**: Back-test the strategy on historical data before deploying it in a live trading environment.
4. **Risk Management**: Use proper risk management techniques to limit potential losses.

## Prerequisites
- **Software**: Python 3.x, with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Trading Platform**: Access to a trading platform or broker API that supports algorithmic trading.

## Future Enhancements
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Implementation of machine learning techniques for the dynamic adjustment of RSI and EMA thresholds based on market conditions.
- **Real-time Data Integration**: Incorporate real-time market data for more responsive trading signals.
- **Additional Indicators**: Expand the strategy by including other indicators like Bollinger Bands, MACD, and others for improved accuracy.
